# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

## Overview
This repository hosts a project that applies deep learning techniques for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. It demonstrates the use of TensorFlow and Keras to classify images into various categories such as planes, cars, birds, cats, and more.

## Features
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to build and train a deep learning model.
- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: Employs the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains images across ten different categories.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes steps for preprocessing the images to make them suitable for model training.
- **Model Architecture**: Implements a Sequential model with layers such as Dense, Activation, and Dropout.
- **Visualization and Evaluation**: Uses Matplotlib and PIL for data visualization and employs a confusion matrix for model evaluation.
- **TensorBoard Integration**: Integrates TensorBoard for tracking model performance and metrics.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- NumPy

## Installation
To set up this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/saeed-rhimi/imageClassification.git
   ```
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib pillow
   ```

## Usage
After setting up the environment, open and run the Jupyter Notebook (`main.ipynb`) to train and evaluate the image classification model. Ensure to follow the instructions in the notebook for the best experience.
